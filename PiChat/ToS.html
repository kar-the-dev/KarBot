      <b><i>Pi Chat - Rules</i></b>
    </h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Do not intentionally reveal to the school staff that the chatroom
        exists. Doing so will get you instantly banned permanently.
      </li>
      <li>
        Never use slurs (including those shaming you for your gender, culture,
        race, ethnic group, sexuality, or anything else).
      </li>
      <li>
        Never send malicious files (malware, adware, spyware, bloatware, etc.)
        or anything over 25MB without <i>explicit</i> permission. This includes
        private messages. Even if this is done by means of direct messaging, it
        is not allowed as all storage is paid for and maintained by Elijah and
        he will be notified immediately.
      </li>
      <li>
        No alt accounts to evade bans, they will immediately be deactivated. You
        may additionally be IP banned to prevent additional alt accounts.
        <h6>
          Every additional alt account adds to your ban until you are
          permanently banned.
        </h6>
      </li>
