      <b><i>Pi Chat - Rules</i></b>
    </h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Do not intentionally reveal to the school staff that the chatroom
        exists. Doing so will get you instantly banned permanently.
      </li>
      <li>
        Never use slurs (including those shaming you for your gender, culture,
        race, ethnic group, sexuality, or anything else).
      </li>
      <li>
        Never send malicious files (malware, adware, spyware, bloatware, etc.)
        or anything over 25MB without <i>explicit</i> permission. This includes
        private messages. If you do this even in a DM, it is not allowed as all
        storage is paid for and maintained by Elijah and he will be notified
        immediately.
      </li>
      <li>
        No alt accounts to evade bans, they will immediately be deactivated. You
        may additionally be IP banned to prevent additional alt accounts.
      </li>
    </ol>
